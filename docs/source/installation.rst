Installation guide
==================

C++ supported compilers:

|gcc version|

|clang version|

|msvc version|

The `DNetPRO` project is written in `C++` and it supports also older standard versions (std=c++1+).
The package installation can be performed via [`CMake`](https://github.com/Nico-Curti/DNetPRO/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt).
The `CMake` installer provides also a `DNetPRO.pc`, useful if you want link to the `DNetPRO` using `pkg-config`.

You can also use the `DNetPRO` package in `Python` using the `Cython` wrap provided inside this project.
The only requirements are the following:

* numpy >= 1.16.0
* networkx >= 2.2
* cython >= 0.29
* scikit -learn >= 0.19.1
* pandas >= 0.24.2

The `Cython` version can be built and installed via `CMake` enabling the `-DPYWRAP` variable.
You can use also the `DNetPRO` package in `Python` using the `Cython` wrap provided inside this project.
The `Python` wrap guarantees also a good integration with the other common Machine Learning tools provided by `scikit-learn` `Python` package; in this way you can use the `DNetPRO` algorithm as an equivalent alternative also in other pipelines.
Like other Machine Learning algorithm also the `DNetPRO` one depends on many parameters, i.e its hyper-parameters, which has to be tuned according to the given problem.
The `Python` wrap of the library was written according to `scikit-optimize` `Python` package to allow an easy hyper-parameters optimization using the already implemented classical methods.
